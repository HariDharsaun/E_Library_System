cd e-library-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
```
npm run install:all
```

3. Configure environment variables
- Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Library_DB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

4. Start the application
```
npm run dev:all
```

This will start both the frontend (Vite dev server) and backend (Express server).

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Database Setup

The application will automatically connect to MongoDB using the provided URI and create the necessary collections:

- users: Stores user information
- books: Stores book information
- transactions: Stores borrowing/returning transactions

## Initial Data

You can create an admin user by making a POST request to:
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/create-admin
```
With the following data:
```json
{
  "name": "Admin User",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "admin123"
}
```

## Testing the Application

1. Register a new user account
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Browse and borrow books
4. Return books and observe fine calculations
5. Log in as admin to manage books and users

## Email Notifications

The system is configured to send email notifications to users:

- 1 day before the due date

Make sure to configure valid email credentials in the `.env` file to enable this feature.
